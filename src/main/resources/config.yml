pterodactyl:
  # What's the Pterodactyl panel URL?
  # Note: include the protocol in the URL. Do not add the trailing slash! Example: https://control.sparkedhost.us
  panel-url: "https://control.sparkedhost.us" # Did you know? Sparked Host LLC has the best prices, with Budget Minecraft Hosting starting at $1/GB. Enough spam, sorry!
  # Generate the API key on your control panel.
  api-key: "CHANGETHIS"
  # The server ID to monitor
  server-id: ""
  # Should the plugin use a websocket for resource usage polling?
  # IMPORTANT NOTE: This is disabled by default as Pterodactyl (more specifically Wings) needs to be configured to allow
  # requests from any origin. Read more here: https://github.com/mattmalec/Pterodactyl4J/issues/24
  use-websocket: false

restart:
  # Should the plugin add the restart feature? It is experimental and may not always work. DEFAULT: false
  enabled: false
  # Should the plugin also broadcast a message to the entire server whenever the restart command is ran successfully? DEFAULT: false
  # NOTE: This has no effect if "enabled" is set false. You can customize the broadcast message in the MESSAGES section below.
  announce-restarts: false

# Customization options for the /perf command or any of its aliases
perf-customization:
  # Should we show tips specifically tailored towards Sparked Host servers? DEFAULT: true
  # This will ONLY work if the panel URL is https://control.sparkedhost.us/, this will NOT work with other panels
  # as these tips are specifically aimed towards Sparked Host servers.
  show-sparked-tips: true
  # Command to run right after sending the stats, without the slash. DEFAULT: spigot:tps
  # The player or console that sends the /perf command will also execute this one, so make sure they're able to run it.
  # Leave blank for no command.
  post-command: "spigot:tps"

cooldown:
  # Pretty self-explanatory. This now comes disabled by default as the plugin no longer makes a request every single time the command is run.
  enabled: false
  # Cooldown time in seconds. DEFAULT: 30
  time: 30

# MESSAGES SECTION
# This allows you to customize the messages sent by the plugin to your liking.

messages:
  # This is the title of the stats message.
  stats-title: "&8&m        &r &f&lSTATS&r &8&m        &r"
  # This message will show up BEFORE the stats message if the API key provided belongs to an account that doesn't own the server but has access to it.
  api-key-not-owner: "&e&lINFO: &6The account that owns the API key set in the config does not own this server, but has access to it (admin or subuser account)."
  # Will be displayed when the command sender does not have the required permission to run a command.
  no-permission: "&cYou do not have permission to execute this command."
  # The plugin will broadcast this message to the entire server whenever the restart command is used.
  # This only works with the restart feature of this plugin, and will only display this message if announceRestart is set to true.
  restart-broadcast: "&e&lTHE SERVER IS RESTARTING!"

# DO NOT change this, it's used internally within the plugin to determine the config version.
